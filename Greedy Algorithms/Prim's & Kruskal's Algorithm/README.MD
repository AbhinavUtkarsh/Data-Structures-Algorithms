# [Prim's & Kruskal's Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlRH0eK-qQ)
Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithm are both very famous greedy paradigm following algorithms, while both of the algorithms are aimed to find the [Minimum Spanning Tree](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/minimum-spanning-tree/tutorial/) from a given graph but they surely differ in the way they achieve this feat.
## Prim's Elaboration
Prim's Algorithm starts with choosing any vertex and then finding the minimum cost edge attached to that chosen vertex. Now we have a tree with 2 vertices and hence now we can select minimum cost edge from any of these 2 vertices and hence making our tree with 3 vertices. This process is followed until every vertex is included in the Minimum spanning tree.
Well now after knowing this it's a no brainier to deuced that Prim's algorithm just can't work with disconnected graphs but well that's why we have Kruskal's Algorithm right after we discuss Prim's actual Algorithm.
